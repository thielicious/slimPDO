# slimPDO
##### Tweaked extension for prepared statements and queries
---

<br>

## INTRODUCTION

Just a small tweaked PDO extension for my own personal use.

<br>

## SETUP INFORMATION

Use your CLI and enter the following to clone:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/thielicious/slimPDO.git`

<br>

## USAGE

Since it's packed in a trait called **DB**, you only need to `use` it in any class you want:
```
if (trait_exists("DB")) { // optional
  class some_class {
    use DB;
    // ...
```
Now, instead of:
```
$stmt = $this->pdo->prepare($sql);
$stmt->execute([":param" => "value"]);
```
Just do this:
```
$this->pdo->prep($sql,[":param" => $value]);
```
Example:
```
foreach ($this->pdo->prep("SELECT * FROM `edit` WHERE `e_name` = :ev",
	[":ev" => $event]) as $ev) {
	echo "<p>{$ev->e_content}</p>";
}
```
