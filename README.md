# slimPDO
##### Tweaked extension for prepared statements and queries
---

<br>

## INTRODUCTION

Just a small tweaked PDO extension for my own personal use.

<br>

## SETUP INFORMATION

Use your CLI and enter the following to clone:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/thielicious/cImgur.git`

<br>

## USAGE

Since it's packed in a trait called **DB**, you only have to `use` it in any class you want. :
```
if (trait_exists("DB")) { // optional
  class some_class {
    use DB;
    // ...
```

<br>

###### Feel free to pull and edit, work whatever.
